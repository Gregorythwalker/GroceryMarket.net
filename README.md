Grocery market solution

Please make sure GroceryConsole is the start up project - this will kick the class library off.
The GroceryConsole.csproj file is pointing to ..\CheckOutTerminal\bin\Debug\CheckOutTerminal.dll - In case of something crazy please build CheckOutTerminal and add reference to this DLL.
To exit the console please write "done" then hit enter.
Instructions on how to operate will appear in console when project is run.
